      <h1>Terms of Service</h1>
      <p class="subtitle">
        Please read these Terms carefully before purchasing or accessing any
        digital training content from Proyecto X.
      </p>
      <p class="updated"><strong>Last updated:</strong> March 2025</p>

      <div class="highlight-box">
        <div class="highlight-title">Summary (not a substitute for the full Terms)</div>
        <p>
          Proyecto X offers instant-access digital training. Payments are processed
          securely by <strong>Paddle</strong> as Merchant of Record. Access is personal
          and non-transferable. A limited 24-hour refund window applies only under
          specific conditions described below.
        </p>
      </div>

      <h2>1. About Proyecto X</h2>
      <p>
        Proyecto X is an online platform operated from the Dominican Republic that
        provides digital educational content, including pre-recorded video modules,
        scripts and related materials (collectively, the “Digital Products”).
      </p>
      <p>
        The Service is aimed primarily at professionals seeking to improve their sales
        skills with clients based in the United States and other markets.
      </p>

      <h2>2. Merchant of Record & Payments</h2>
      <p>
        All payments are processed by <strong>Paddle</strong>, which acts as the
        Merchant of Record. Paddle is responsible for billing, payment collection,
        tax calculation and compliance with card network rules.
      </p>
      <p>
        When you complete a purchase, your payment contract is with Paddle. Proyecto X
        does not store your full payment card details.
      </p>

      <h2>3. Eligibility</h2>
      <p>By using the Service, you represent and warrant that you:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Are at least 18 years old or the age of majority in your jurisdiction.</li>
        <li>Have the legal capacity to enter into a binding contract.</li>
        <li>Will use the Service only for lawful purposes and in accordance with these Terms.</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>4. Access to Digital Products</h2>
      <p>
        Upon successful payment confirmation from Paddle, you are granted access to
        the purchased Digital Product. Unless otherwise stated in writing, access is:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Personal</strong> – only you are permitted to use the content.</li>
        <li><strong>Non-transferable</strong> – you may not share or resell access.</li>
        <li><strong>Non-exclusive</strong> – we may sell the same content to other users.</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>5. Intellectual Property</h2>
      <p>
        All videos, scripts, lesson structures, documentation, branding and other
        materials available through the Service are protected by copyright and other
        intellectual property laws in the Dominican Republic, the United States and
        other jurisdictions.
      </p>
      <p>You agree that you will not:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Copy, record, distribute or publicly display any Digital Product.</li>
        <li>Upload any portion of our content to social media, public forums or file-sharing sites.</li>
        <li>Resell, sublicense or provide access to any third party without written permission.</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>6. Prohibited Uses</h2>
      <p>
        You may not use the Service in any way that violates applicable law or these Terms, including:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>Engaging in fraud, misrepresentation or unauthorized access.</li>
        <li>Attempting to interfere with the security or integrity of the Service.</li>
        <li>Reverse engineering, scraping or exploiting vulnerabilities in the Service.</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>7. Pricing, Taxes and Currency</h2>
      <p>
        Prices for Digital Products are displayed prior to checkout and may be updated
        from time to time. Any applicable taxes (such as VAT or sales taxes) are
        calculated and collected by Paddle based on your location and applicable law.
      </p>
      <p>
        Charges will appear on your statement using the descriptors provided by Paddle
        and may reference Paddle as the Merchant of Record.
      </p>

      <h2>8. Limited Refund Policy</h2>
      <p>
        Because our Digital Products are delivered with instant access, refunds are
        limited and subject to the separate
        <a href="/refund.html">Refund Policy</a>. In summary:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>You may request a refund within <strong>24 hours</strong> of completing the purchase.</li>
        <li>No refund is available once that 24-hour period has expired.</li>
        <li>No refund is available if the Digital Product has been <strong>fully consumed</strong> (e.g., the video has been watched to completion).</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        Proyecto X reserves the right to review technical usage data (such as playback
        progress logs, access times and IP information) to determine whether a Digital
        Product has been consumed in full before deciding on any refund request.
      </p>

      <h2>9. Disclaimer of Results</h2>
      <p>
        The Service provides educational information only. We do not guarantee any
        particular financial, professional or business outcome. Your results depend on
        your own skills, decisions and circumstances.
      </p>

      <h2>10. Limitation of Liability</h2>
      <p>
        To the maximum extent permitted by applicable law, Proyecto X shall not be liable
        for any indirect, incidental, special, consequential or punitive damages, or for
        any loss of profits or revenues, arising out of or relating to your use of the
        Service or Digital Products.
      </p>
      <p>
        In any case, our total aggregate liability for any claim shall not exceed the
        amount actually paid by you for the Digital Product giving rise to the claim.
      </p>

      <h2>11. Modifications to the Service and Terms</h2>
      <p>
        We may modify, suspend or discontinue any part of the Service at any time.
        We may also update these Terms from time to time. When we do, we will change
        the “Last updated” date at the top of this page. Your continued use of the
        Service after changes take effect constitutes acceptance of the updated Terms.
      </p>

      <h2>12. Governing Law and Jurisdiction</h2>
      <p>
        These Terms are governed by the laws of the <strong>Dominican Republic</strong>,
        without regard to conflict-of-law rules. Consumers located in the United States
        may also benefit from mandatory protections under federal and state consumer laws.
      </p>

      <h2>13. Contact Information</h2>
      <p>
        If you have any questions regarding these Terms, please contact us at:<br />
